 <h5 className="pt-5 pb-4 text-center fw-bold">When creating terms of service, you should also make sure to avoid the following three common pitfalls:</h5>
 <div className="card  px-5 bgc">
   <div className="card-body ">
    <ol className="list-group list-group-flush">
    <li className="list">Copying another site's provisions, as they may be inappropriate or irrelevant for your e-commerce business.</li>
    <li className="list">Your company not abiding by its own rules and responsibilities, especially concerning user privacy or the sale of email addresses to third parties.</li>
    <li className="list">Using outdated provisions that fail to account for new website features or changes in the law.</li>

 < h2 className="pt-5 pb-4 text-center fw-bold">Privacy Policy</h2> 
   <div className="card px-5 bgc" >
   <div className="card-body col ">
    <p>A privacy policy is a document that states how your e-commerce business will gather,
     use, and manage customers' data. It needs to explain which personal information 
     is collected, how it's used, and how it's protected.</p>
    <p>Every website that collects personal information from visitors is required by privacy regulations like the have a privacy policy.
         These contracts may provide some liability protection
        in the event of a dispute over the way your business handles personal information.
         Privacy policies are a helpful tool for promoting trust and transparency between your business and its customers.</p>

  <h2 className=" pt-5 pb-4 text-center fw-bold">User Agreements</h2> 
   <div className="card px-5 bgc" >
   <div className=" px-5 card-body col">
    <p>A user agreement is any contract between a website user and the site's owner or operator. 
        These e-commerce contracts can be end-user license agreements (EULAs), terms of service/terms and conditions, or privacy policies. 
        They outline the rights and obligations of both parties. Agreements for users provide the conditions under which a user may use your website. 
        This limits your company's legal obligations and explains the circumstances required for termination.</p>

   <div>
  <h2 className=" pt-5 pb-4 text-center fw-bold">Return Policy</h2> 
   <div className="card px-5 bgc" >
   <div className=" px-5 card-body col">
    <p>Customers will inevitably return purchased products, so your e-commerce business needs a return policy. There is no legal obligation for e-commerce companies to accept returns,
         which means a return policy is discretional. Nevertheless, it's a good idea to offer returns. It means you can account for defective products and build trust between buyers and sellers. 
         Because it isn't a legal document like a privacy policy or terms of service, a return policy can be relatively simple. It should address the following issues:</p>
    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
    <li className="list">Length of return policy</li>
    <li className="list">Condition of returned items</li>
    <li className="list">Eligibility of returns</li>
    <li className="list">Which party pays for shipping</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    </div>

   <div>
  <h2 className=" pt-5 pb-4 text-center fw-bold">Subscription Agreement</h2> 
   <div className="card px-5 bgc" >
   <div className=" px-5 card-body col">
    <p>If your e-commerce business is subscription-based, you will also need to create and manage a subscription agreement that addresses the purchasing and delivery of goods. 
        While these provisions can be incorporated into the terms of service, it's best to keep them in a separate e-commerce</p>
    <p>A subscription agreement should cover the specific issues that can occur with your company's sale of its products or services. Some provisions to consider covering include:</p>
    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
    <li className="list">Website membership agreements</li>
    <li className="list">Electronic signatures</li>
    <li className="list">Consumer protection law compliance</li>
    <li className="list">Information licensing</li>
    <li className="list">Disclaimers/waivers</li>
    <li className="list">Shipping policies</li>
    <li className="list">Export controls</li>
    <li className="list">Product warranties</li>
    <li className="list">Sales tax</li>

  <h2 className=" pt-5 pb-4 text-center fw-bold">Non-disclosure agreement (NDA)</h2> 
   <div className="card px-5 bgc" >
   <div className=" px-5 card-body col">
    <p>Many e-commerce businesses use independent contractors. If you do, you should have NDAs in place. NDA is a contract that prohibits the sharing of confidential information. 
        It prevents proprietary information about your business from being leaked to the public.</p>

    </div>
    </div>


    <div>
  <h5 className=" pt-5 pb-4 text-center fw-bold">Some common elements of a vendor contract include:</h5>

  <h2 className=" pt-5 pb-4 text-center fw-bold">Service-level agreement (SLA)</h2> 
   <div className="card px-5 bgc" >
   <div className=" px-5 card-body col">
    <p>Your e-commerce business will need a web host and software service providers. For that, 
        you'll need to negotiate and manage SLA.</p>
    </div>
    </div>
    </div>


    <div>
  <h4 className=" pt-5 pb-4 text-center fw-bold">A service-level agreement will:</h4>

  <h2 className=" pt-5  pb-4 text-center fw-bold">Master service agreement (MSA)</h2> 
   <div className="card px-5 bgc" >
   <div className=" px-5 card-body col">
    <p>IT is a contract between two parties that lists the terms that will govern future agreements and transactions.</p>
    <p>In the case of e-commerce, your business would need an MSA if you would like to have a long-term business relationship with web hosts or software service providers. 
        The SLAs that you sign with these companies can be included in an MSA. This can streamline the negotiation process,
         while still allowing for modifications should there be a change in circumstances.</p>

   <div className=" px-5 card-body ">
   <ol class="list-group list-group-flush col">
    <li className="list">Product Protection: Most customers have certain expectations about the products they purchase and the issues the seller will cover. By offering a warranty, your e-commerce business can set expectations and deliver on promises to consumers.</li>
    <li className="list">Product Quality: For expensive purchases, customers expect a high level of product quality. A warranty demonstrates that your company is willing to stand behind its products and will make consumers feel confident about your brand.</li>
    <li className="list">Customer Service: A poor customer service experience can lead to lost customers and a negative view of your brand. Extended warranties, especially in conjunction with a product protection company partnership, should be able to provide consumers with excellent support that will positively impact your brand.</li>
    <li className="list">Flexibility: Inflexible return policies can prevent customers from making purchases or lead to unhappy customers if they purchase a product that does not meet their needs. By offering warranties that allow easy cancellation or transferability, your e-commerce business provides consumers with valuable flexibility.</li>
